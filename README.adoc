== The bbackup script

bbackup is a Python wrapper script for
https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[borg backup].
It is designed for use on a personal computer (i.e. not always on, and usually
with one user logged in when it is on). bbackup handles various housekeeping
tasks that go along with actually performing the backup. bbackup was written
for Ubuntu 20.04 with the standard GNOME desktop, and has not been tested on
other systems. I wrote bbackup purely to meet my own needs, but it (or parts
of it) may also be useful to other borg users.

In a typical run, bbackup will:

* Read a configuration from YAML files in a configuration directory.
* Read an exclude list from the configuration directory.
* Use GNOME secret-tool to obtain the borg password for repository access.
* Run a shell script (expected to be created on X session start-up) to obtain
  values for the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`
  variables, to allow passwordless access to remote repositories over SSH.
* Determine the currently used router's MAC address, check it against a
  pre-configured whitelist, and abort if it's not whitelisted (to avoid backing
  up over slow, metered, or untrusted connections).
* Perform a backup by calling borg with the parameters from the configuration
  (as well as some currently hard-coded parameters).
* Prune the borg repository (the prune parameters are currently hard-coded).
* Compact the borg repository.
* Tee all borg output to a log file.
* Archive and rotate log files with logrotate. Currently, log file archives are
  stored in the configuration directory.

== Other scripts in this repository

`save-sockets-to-file` is a bash script designed to be run on X session
start-up. It creates another bash script which sets the values of
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`. This is needed if
performing a headless backup over SSH (e.g. with anacron), since these
variables are only available in the user session.

`plotborg.py` shows a simple graphical representation of the time points
of archives listed by `borg list`, which can be useful when reviewing the
contents of a borg repository.

== Invocation

`bbackup /path/to/<global-config-dir>/<profile-config-dir>`

`<global-config-dir>` is a directory containing a top-level bbackup YAML
configuration file, an exclude file, and one or more subdirectories containing
the configuration and log files for a particular profile. This structure
lets multiple profiles share an exclude file and some configuration settings.

== Configuration

See the directory `example-config` in this repository for a sample
configuration structure.
